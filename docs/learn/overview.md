# Overview

### Privacy

Infinium is completely private by default, making use of stealth
addresses, ring signatures, and from the moment we perform our Infinities
hardfork, also RingCT.

### Security

Our blockchain is protected by our custom hybrid PoW/PoS
consensus algorithm, pairing the advantages of each process to create a
highly secure platform. This makes the system less prone to double-spend
attacks, improving overall security.

### Scalability

Achieving computational excellence with forward/backward
compatibility, modular design, and an asynchronous core. This makes our
blockchain scalable and ready to handle high volumes of traffic.

### Infinities

Worldâ€™s first Proof of Stake scheme that enhances traditional PoS with untraceability and hidden amounts, revolutionising blockchain consensus.

### Confidential Assets

Anyone can easily issue their own currencies and digital tokens on the Infinium chain; assets secured by the same mechanisms
that make Infinium so much more secure than first-generation cryptocurrencies,
namely hidden addresses, hidden amounts and IP obfuscation.

### Ionic Swaps

An improvement on Atomic Swaps, innovating seamless cryptocurrency exchanges while preserving user privacy.

### Marketplace API

Explore our dynamic API, facilitating a seamless integration into the marketplace ecosystem. This feature allows anyone to spin up their own decentralized marketplace.

### Escrow Contracts

Our escrow service empowers users with customizable contracts in a trustless environment, secured by deposits to deter
malfeasance.

### Staking

Our implementation of Proof of Stake is as egalitarian as it can be. There is no minimum staking amount, so anyone can participate, contributing
to our vision of having a highly decentralized ecosystem that anyone can use.

### Aliases

All Infinium Network users can create aliases, for example: @username. These aliases can be linked to a payment address, which makes
our network more user friendly. In the long run, aliases will be used in a
dedicated messenger, a user reputation service, and an alias-based
authentication system.

### Auditable wallets

Auditable wallets give people and organizations the option to create transparent wallets for situations where we would rather verify than
trust.
