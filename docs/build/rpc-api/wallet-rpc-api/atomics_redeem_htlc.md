Redeems atomic swap.

URL: ```http://127.0.0.1:31113/json_rpc```
### Request: 
```json
{
    "jsonrpc": "2.0",
    "id": 0,
    "method": "atomics_redeem_htlc",
    "params": {
        "tx_id": "",
        "origin_secret_as_hex": ""
    }
}
```

### Request parameters: 
```json
    "tx_id": Identify transaction which carry needed HTLC, by this we basically identify HTLC itself. (Theoretically one transaction can carry more then 1 HTLC, but since this unlikely will ever be used, current implementation of the wallet assume it only one HTLC per tx, and we identify HTLC by carrying tx_id. This can be changed in future, if needed, without hardfork).
    "origin_secret_as_hex": Secret for HTLC, encoded in HEX. (sha256 supposed to be calculated from raw secret blob).
```
