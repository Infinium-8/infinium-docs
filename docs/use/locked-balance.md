# Locked Balance

On occasion, you may notice that part of your wallet balance is temporarily locked. The reason behind it is complex, but let us offer a simplified explanation here. For more details, please refer to the [whitepaper](https://docs.infinium.space/docs/whitepaper.pdf).

As you may know already thereâ€™s no such thing as account balance in the blockchain. Instead each wallet consists of inputs and outputs. Due to the nature of incoming transactions, the amount in a wallet balance can get fragmented. When you try to send a particular amount, your transaction will be split in outgoing and change amounts. Here is example.

```
Alice has 100 coins and sends 50 to Bob
Transaction of 100 coins creates in the blockchain
50 coins goes to Bob and 50 coins goes to Alice
```

Infinium architecture demands 10 confirmations for this change transaction and that amount gets locked in the wallet. Therefore, lock time is 10 blocks behind or approximately 10 minutes.
