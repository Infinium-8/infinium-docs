# Reporting Issues

Infinium team puts a lot of hard work to bring you the best blockchain experience possible and it's highly unlikeable you will face any troubles using our product. However if you experience any technical issues we suggest you make a report to our development team.

All you need to do is to follow the [report link](https://github.com/Infinium-8/Infinium/issues), describe your situation and submit a request. Or join our [Discord](https://discord.gg/jRQZMr9u84) and post it in the #support channel.

## Log files

In most cases log files are essential for troubleshooting. It could be wise to attach them to the report you submit. Specifically, `Infinium.log` or `infiniumd.log` would be useful for our dev team. They are stored in different locations depending on OS:

### Windows

```
C:\Users\<USER NAME>\AppData\Roaming\Infinium
```

### MacOS

```
/Users/<USER NAME>/Library/Application Support/Infinium
```

### Linux

```
~/.Infinium
```
