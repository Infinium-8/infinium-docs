# Managing Wallets

Infinium app lets you manage multiple Infinium wallets, which can be easily created, restored and removed from the app. The core of each wallet is a seed phrase. It's a sequence of 24 words, that can be used to recovery your wallet private and public keys. Every time you create a new wallet within the app, a unique sequence is generated. It's important to always keep it safe and accessible.

For your convenience it's not necessary to use a seed phrase to manage your wallet. When you create a wallet the wallet file is generated as well. The file is secured with additional password and grants access to wallet features and the seed phrase. It can be copied to another device and used with another app.
